It is so loud, that it requires me to sleep with earplugs in and to have either music or television on at all times when sitting in my living room to try to drown out the sound.  I am a physician at Yale and am used to the repetitive beeping of machines which generally is not bothersome in the slightest...this is a different level, as it is SO loud and does not stop.

1542913,41.3072190936921,-72.9249047,Closed,Parking Violation/Abandoned Auto,"I have a Honda Accord Hybrid and I maintain a a current valid NH hybrid parking permit.  Several years ago I was repeatedly getting parking tickets on my car for expired meter.  I repeatedly took them over to T&P at 200 Orange, where they would void them, wasting my time and your admin time.  Finally someone was able to fix ""the system"" so that when the T&P officers scan my license plate, my hybrid permit came up -- hence, no more tickets.
I was downtown on 3/18/15, parked in front of City Hall and promptly got a ticket.  I walked it over to 200 Orange.  First I was told to formally dispute it -- uh, no.  Then I was told I would have to take a photo of the permit on my car and show it to them to prove I have one.  Um, I don't think so.  I escalated the issue to a third, very reluctant employee, who finally voided the ticket. I asked why I got the ticket when there had not been a problem for several years.  I was told there is a ""new system.""  I  sense the beginning of another continuing problem.
Please check your ""new system"" to make sure hybrid permits are available to T&P officers as they write parking tickets.  
Also, please advise your T&P personnel that the burden to ""prove"" they have a valid hybrid permit should not rest on residents taking a photo of it.

1536487,41.3184366112478,-72.9144001187574,Open,Deadly Bike Lane,"Dear New Haven Transportation, Public Works, and Public Safety,

The Orange street bike lane north and southbound from Trumbull St. to Willow St. is a death trap. I made the mistake of trying to commute to work on bike and had to swerve potholes and debris the entire time while worrying about traffic, buses, and poorly parked cars. This was the most unsafe ride I have ever had, anywhere - and this was supposed to be the major north/south biking artery of East Rock. 

At one point, I had to try and jump a pothole and my rear tire didn't make it causing a flat tire and slightly bent rim. I am mad about my expensive commuter bike, but honestly, mostly just relieved I didn't tumble into traffic or hit my face. Some of these pot holes are more than 6 inches deep. A pothole for a car is an inconvenience with the possibility of tire/rim damage; a pothole on a bike however is a major safety concern- people have been killed like that.

All roads in East Rock are in horrible shape coming out of a long winter, understandably it will take some time to address this issue everywhere. But please, please, fix the bike lanes first. 

If you are looking to commute on bike, strongly consider taking a bus or walking until roads are improved. New Haven City officials, please try riding a bike in one of these bike lanes and reporting back.

I will follow up later with photos",19,2015-03-17T13:40:30-04:00,2015-03-18T11:51:35-04:00,,None
